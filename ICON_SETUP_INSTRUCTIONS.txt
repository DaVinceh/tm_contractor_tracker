APP ICON SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
============================

STEP 1: Save the Logo Image
----------------------------
1. Take the contractor tracker logo image (the one you provided)
2. Save it as: c:\tm_contractor_tracker\assets\icons\app_icon.png
3. Make sure it's a PNG file
4. Recommended size: 1024x1024 pixels (or at least 512x512)

STEP 2: Generate the Icons
---------------------------
After placing the image file, run this command in PowerShell:

cd c:\tm_contractor_tracker
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons

This will automatically generate all required icon sizes for Android.

STEP 3: Rebuild the APK
------------------------
After icons are generated, build a new APK:

flutter build apk --release

STEP 4: Install on Phone
-------------------------
The new APK will have the contractor tracker logo as the app icon!

============================

If you get an error about the image not found:
- Double-check the file is at: assets\icons\app_icon.png
- Make sure it's a valid PNG image
- Try opening the image in an image viewer to verify it's not corrupted
